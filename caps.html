							<h3>Aubrey Davis Park: Mercer Island, WA</h3>
							<p>Aubrey Davis Park was formed on top of a freeway lid over I-90. The park was
							created to minimize impacts of the freeway on nearby residents from I-90.
							It opened to the public as a park in 1990. It was renamed in honor of their former mayor Aubrey Davis, who lobbied for
							the park's creation in the 1970s, after her passing.

								<p>
									The construction of I-670 in Columbus in 1965 split neighborhoods from downtown. In 1996, a revitalization
									project that initially planned to expand the highway, turned into a plan to cap the highway into a vibrant streetscape with shops and restaurants, bridging the urban divide.
